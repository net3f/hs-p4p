- Check that we don't send requests to ourselves

Cleanups
========

- TODO(cleanup): turn Finish functions into timeout "cleanup" functions only, that assume their inputs exist

- insertNodeId can maybe call oreqEnsure directly instead of icmdOReqRequest, then we don't need to screw around with "Maybe CmdId" etc

- review uses of unsafeIx
- TODO(log): turn more errors into LogMsg

- TODO(bump-to): have IReq/ICmd bump their own timeouts every time something interesting happens

later:
- refactor & cleanup k-bucket maintenance code
- TODO(addr)
- TODO(retry)

Rate limiting
=============

- Implement some policy-based bounded map where certain keys are exempt, or something
  Then kRecvReq needs to be bounded
  (and think about how to fold SentReqId into this)
- Rework the bounds fer kSendReq and kRecvCmd in terms of the new policy-based bounded map
