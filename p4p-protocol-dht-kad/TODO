- ! enforce the bounds on the bounded data structures

- Check that we don't send requests to ourselves. Although it doesn't matter
  too much, we cache and re-use them anyways...

Cleanups
========

- drop unnecessary monadic stuff in Internal.hs
- review uses of unsafeIx
- TODO(bump-to): have IReq/ICmd bump their own timeouts every time something interesting happens

later:
- refactor & cleanup k-bucket maintenance code
- TODO(addr)
- TODO(retry)

Rate limiting
=============

- Implement some policy-based bounded map where certain keys are exempt, or something
  Then kRecvReq needs to be bounded
  (and think about how to fold SentReqId into this)
- Rework the bounds fer kSendReq and kRecvCmd in terms of the new policy-based bounded map
